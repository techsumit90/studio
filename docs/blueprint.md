## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue (#3B82F6), inspired by the original request, for a professional and modern look. Chosen for its versatility, this vibrant hue will contrast well with the light background.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E0F7FA) to create a clean and open feel. This subtle tint, closely related to the primary hue but desaturated, offers a gentle contrast that avoids harshness.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#FFB74D), an analogous color to blue, provides a gentle contrast and visual interest to icons. Being significantly different from the primary color in saturation and brightness, it enhances clarity.
- Font family: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, machined look, used throughout the website for headings and body text.
- Use modern, minimalist icons with soft orange accents to represent services and key features.
- Maintain a clean, grid-based layout with rounded corners and soft shadows for a modern SaaS aesthetic.
- Implement subtle hover and scroll animations to enhance user engagement and provide a premium feel.
